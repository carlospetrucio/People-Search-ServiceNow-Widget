📜 This widget allows the creation of a search field that uses the user's "userid" to consult their data in the user table and display it to those who consult directly in the service portal or employee center.

💡 Simplifies the user consultation process for the end user.  
💡 Allows you to create filters in the query through the script, selecting which types of users can be queried or ignored..  
💡 Ready-to-use script. (copy and paste).    
💡 The user fields to be displayed can be easily changed.

You must know how to create a new widget.
