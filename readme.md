<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PeopleSearch-Active-brightgreen">

üìú This widget allows the creation of a search field that uses the user's "userid" to consult their data in the user table and display it to those who consult directly in the service portal or employee center.

üí° Simplifies the user consultation process for the end user.  
üí° Allows you to create filters in the query through the script, selecting which types of users can be queried or ignored..  
üí° Ready-to-use script. (copy and paste).    
üí° The user fields to be displayed can be easily changed.

You must know how to create a new widget.

Step 4 - Now you must define a name, description and ‚ÄúID‚Äù for your widget, then click on the context menu and save. (Burger Menu)
Remember to add the necessary role to the "roles" option if you want to limit the widget's display to certain types of users.

Step 7 ‚Äì Copy the contents of the ‚ÄúServe Script.js‚Äù file and paste it into ‚ÄúServer script‚Äù in the widget editor.
It will be the code responsible for connecting to the user table and carrying out the query. It is in this file that you can make changes to GlideRecord if you need queries for users of specific types.

Step 8 - Copy the contents of the file "Client Script.js" and paste it into "Client Controller" or "Client Script"  if you are using the editor widget.
